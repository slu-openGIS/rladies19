# "Hi, I'm Chris"

.pull-left[ 
* Assistant Professor of Sociology at Saint Louis University
* I teach statistics, GIS, and classes on urban and health issues
* I'm interested in how neighborhoods shape our lives, and how we in turn shape neighborhoods...
* ...which means I spend a lot of time using bulk administrative data released by cities.

# Barriers to Joyful Data

* There is no single API access point for data from the City
* Closed formats (`.pdf`, Access Databases) are the norm
* Untidy data abounds

# Barriers to Joyful Data

* Untidy data abounds
* Answering questions with the City's data also requires specialized GIS skills
* Geocoding is expensive
    * for example, geocoding the 1.4 million Citizens' Service Bureau incidents would cost ~$5,600
